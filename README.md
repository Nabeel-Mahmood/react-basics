# React Basics application.

Welcome to the React Basics application. The aim of this application is to teach the Basics
of building web applications with React.

## Assignments

Each assignment will follow on the result of the previous assignment. The solutions to each
assignment will be published under branches of this repository.

### 1. Display the Todo's.

Use the data in `todoData.js` to display a list of to do elements on the main page of the application.

Once that is working break the display of a single todo out into functional component instead.

### 2. Add a new Todo

On the same page as the Todo list you have just made, add a form to add a Todo.

The `todoData.js` file has an `addTodo` function you can use.

Use controlled `<input>` fields to build the form. Give the form a `submit` button. Understand the different types of `buttons`.

Add fields for:

- heading
- detail
- dueDate

Ensure all your `<input>` fields have accessible labels.

**Bonus**: Add some basic HTML landmark semantics to your application. Use and understand the following tags: `<main>`, `<section>`, `<h2>`
